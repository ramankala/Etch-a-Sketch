This project is a sketchpad where you can make a drawing by moving your mouse over the grid.  You can change the pixel size of the pen by clicking on the refresh button, and this button also clears the grid.  The purpose of the project was to improve my HTML DOM manipulation skills and solidifying my CSS skills.  I learned about the parent-child relationship in HTML with great detail and showcased my mastery on the subject.
